# Pattern printer (Python)

This is a open source pattern printer module for the python 3 that has pre-defined functions to print popular educational/beginner patterns like pyramid, triangle, square etc.

---

## Installation

- Download the **patprint.py** from the repository.
- Paste the file into your working directory/folder.

## Usage

- To use any pattern from the module use the prefix **patprint** (Example: patprint.heart())
